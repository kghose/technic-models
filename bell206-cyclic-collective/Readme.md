## Cyclic? Collective? How helicopters maneuver
  
For a good introduction to how helicpters fly, I suggest this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tdnqZgKa0E

In short, each blade of a helicopter rotor acts like a wing, generating lift as it sweeps through the air, pulling up the aircraft.

By changing the pitch of all blades by the same amount we can increase or decrease vertical thrust, moving the helicopter up or
down. This is called the **collective**.

By setting the pitch of each blade differently we can change the direction of the thrust, moving the helicopter horizontally.
This is called the **cyclic**

There are two interesting problems here: 
1. How to adjust the pitch of the blades as they rotate through a full cycle, since the pitch of each blade under cyclic input 
   has to depend on where it is in its rotation.
2. How to convert mechanical inputs of the cyclic and collective from the stationary cabin, where the pilot sits, to the 
   rotating blades.

## Swashplate

These problems are solved by the **swashplate**. The mechanism of the swashplate is well explained in the linked video, and I have
made a model of the swashplate mechanism in LEGO Technic because I learn by doing and I love to have models of mechanical 
devices where I can see how things work.

## Rigging

While researching this topic I became fascinated not only by swashplate, but by the mechanisms that convert a pilot's cyclic and 
collective inputs to swashplate angles (the **rigging**), so I modeled that too.

As an aside, I was confused by linkage 10 in the diagram for a while, [until a nice person on aviation stack exchange helped me out](aviation-stack-1).

### Note:
The Bell 206 has a servo section between the mixing lever and the swashplate that I did not model. 
The servo section does not add anything educationally and increases clutter. In this respect the model is closer to the 
[Robinson R22](r22). I did not find detailed enough diagrams for the R22 as I did for the Bell, so I modeled the Bell.

## Post-script: Helicopters in the computer age

There are current attempts to replace the mechanical swashplate with servo motors on each blade that would electronically adjust the
pitch of the blades. This would reduce mechanical complexity (and insert new points of failure, IMO) but I'm guessing this can make
the helicopter lighter and perhaps more agile?

## Other LEGO helicopter models with cyclic/collcetive

The aim of my model is educational: clearly expose all the linkages and levers so that the principle of operation can be studied.
The other models listed here aim at creating a playable helicopter model with functioning controls, so the mechanisms are 
completely or partially obscured.

- [Lama Helicopter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U2VM3m6Ypc). It has working collective, cyclic and tail rotor controls 
  beautifully compressed to scale, and it's been motorized. Some of the build is not reqular LEGO. There is a wire connector
  for the cyclic and a modified piece in the rotor. The mechanism is hard to see.
- [Pattspatt's model](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-87154/Pattspatt/helicopter-42110-c-model/#details). 
  This is an impressive helicopter built as an alternate build for the Land Rover set. It has the clearest 
  diagrams for a LEGO helicopter control model I have seen.
- [Ivan_M's AH-77 model](https://rebrickable.com/mocs/MOC-21317/Ivan_M/ah-77-hunter-helicopter/#details)
- [A wonderful KA-32 model from sheepo.es](https://www.sheepo.es/2014/10/kamov-ka-32-coaxial-helicopter.html#more). This is a coaxial helicopter,
  two rotors on top of each other, and the model shows how a swashplate works in this case, which is excellent. Again, the
  mechanism is hard to see.
